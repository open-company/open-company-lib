## Background

> Today, power is gained by sharing knowledge, not hoarding it.

> -- [Dharmesh Shah](https://twitter.com/dharmesh)

Employees and investors, co-founders and execs, they all want more transparency from their startups, but there's no consensus about what it means to be transparent. OpenCompany is a platform that simplifies how key business information is shared with stakeholders.

When information about growth, finances, ownership and challenges is shared transparently, it inspires trust, new ideas and new levels of stakeholder engagement. OpenCompany makes it easy for founders to engage with employees and investors, creating a sense of ownership and urgency for everyone.

[OpenCompany](https://opencompany.com/) is GitHub for the rest of your company.

To maintain transparency, OpenCompany information is always accessible and easy to find. Being able to search or flip through prior updates empowers everyone. Historical context brings new employees and investors up to speed, refreshes memories, and shows how the company is evolving over time.

Transparency expectations are changing. Startups need to change as well if they are going to attract and retain savvy employees and investors. Just as open source changed the way we build software, transparency changes how we build successful startups with information that is open, interactive, and always accessible. The OpenCompany platform turns transparency into a competitive advantage.

Like the open companies we promote and support, the [OpenCompany](https://opencompany.com/) platform is completely transparent. The company supporting this effort, OpenCompany, LLC, is an open company. The [platform](https://github.com/open-company/open-company-web) is open source software, and open company data is [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) accessible through the [platform API](https://github.com/open-company/open-company-api).

## Overview

The OpenCompany Lib project provides a few namespaces which are shared among multiple OpenCompany projects.


## Usage

To use this library in your other projcets, include the following in your dependencies:

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/open-company/lib.svg)](https://clojars.org/open-company/lib)

To use local changes to the lib here in other projects in a development situation, build the lib and install it
locally with:

```
boot build
```

Make sure your lein or boot environment is configured to use the local Maven repository.

## Development

To start a REPL for local development on this library, run:

```
boot repl
```

### Pushing to Clojars

The normal case is for a project to use this library from [Clojars](https://clojars.org/open-company/lib). To push a new version to Clojars, first authorize the release by setting your credentials:

```console
export CLOJARS_USER="<your Clojars username>"
export CLOJARS_PASS="<your Clojars password>"
```

Then build and push the lib:

```
boot build push
```

You can't have any changed or untracked files in your local repo or you'll get an `Assert failed: project repo is not clean`
error.

## Testing

Tests are run in continuous integration of the `master` and `mainline` branches on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/open-company/open-company-lib):

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/open-company/open-company-lib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/open-company/open-company-lib)

To run the tests locally:

```console
boot test!
```

To run tests watching for local changes during development:

```console
boot watch test!
```
